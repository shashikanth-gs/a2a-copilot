# Filesystem Assistant — Sample Workspace File
#
# This file is a seed example that the Filesystem Assistant agent can read.
# Replace or delete it and add your own files to the workspace.
#
# The agent has full read/write access to every file in this directory via
# the filesystem MCP server. Ask the agent things like:
#
#   "What files are in the workspace?"
#   "Summarise the contents of sample.md"
#   "Create a new file called report.txt with a summary of all files here"

## Getting Started

You can place any files you want the agent to work with in this directory:

- Text files, markdown notes, CSVs, JSON data
- Documents you want summarised or analysed
- Templates you want the agent to fill in

The agent cannot access anything outside this directory.
