## Security Considerations

This package acts as an HTTP server. When deploying:

- **Do not expose the A2A server port to the public internet** without authentication/firewall rules unless intentional.
- **Protect your `GITHUB_TOKEN`** — never commit it to source control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- **Review MCP server URLs** configured in `config.json` — the wrapper forwards tool calls to those endpoints.
- **Use the `advertiseHost` config** to control what hostname is embedded in the agent card served to A2A clients.
